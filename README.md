# GL Boids

This is an implementation of the [Boid Flocking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boids) algorithm first introduced by [Craig Reynolds](https://www.red3d.com/cwr/boids/). It uses GLFW and OpenGL for drawing and GLM for maths. The implementation focuses on being simple, but effective. It currently implements a FOV of 360 degrees, although other FOV's are supported.
